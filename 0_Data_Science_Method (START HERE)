As a current data professional and aspiring data scientist, I am going through a detailed walkthrough of Data Science procedure in the following files. 

Why Data Science?
First and foremost, I love data. It is the basis for everything. I love learning about a dataset, how it impacts people and organizations, and how it improves technology. 
I love learning how you can use data to improve people's health and lives. I love the insights that can be gleaned from a robust set of data. 
With data, the possibilities truly feel limitless. 
I want to be a data expert.

  Packages used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn 

  To briefly summarize, this public dataset is from a bike rental company based out of Washington D.C. Each day & hour between 2011 and 2012 is recorded in a row with information such as time of year, weather, rider type, and rider count.
  I used summary statistical calculations to begin exploring the full dataset to answer a few initial questions: 

     - Does the data look correct/overall plausible? (Yes)
     - When are rider counts high? When are they low? What factors might be contributing to each? (See notes below)

  Then, I began exploring subsets of data and found that average ridership was higher during Spring & Summer.
  Next, I began visualizing the data with Matplotlib. I plotted both the full dataset and subsets of the data.
  I used seaborn to create a box plot for a very detailed visualization, learning that average ridership was higher between 6-9 AM and 
  5-8 PM, leading me to the conclusion that the bikes are likely used for commuting to work.
  I also calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient with the corr() method. I found a positive correlation between casual and registered riders, but it was not deterministic. 

In summary, while this was a basic exploration, I gained a lot of insight into this dataset. I learned when ridership was high, when it was low, and what factors affected ridership (such as uncomfortable weather and holidays).
